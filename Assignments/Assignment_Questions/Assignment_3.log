Assignment 3: Dynamic Form Handling with DOM Manipulation

Requirements:
HTML Form Creation:

Create a form with the following fields:
Name (text input)
Email (email input)
Age (number input)
Gender (radio buttons: Male/Female/Other)
Hobbies (checkboxes: Reading, Sports, Music)
Comments (textarea)
A "Submit" button
Real-time Validation:

Validate the Name and Email fields in real-time:
Name must have at least 3 characters.
Email must follow proper email format.
If validation fails, display an error message below the respective field.
Dynamic Feedback:

Add a section below the form that shows live feedback of the form data as the user fills it out.
Example: When the user types their name, display "Hello, [Name]" dynamically.
Submission Behavior:

When the "Submit" button is clicked:
Validate all fields again.
If all fields are valid, display a confirmation message (e.g., "Thank you, [Name]! Your data has been submitted.") below the form.

Clear the form inputs after successful submission.

Bonus Features:

Add a "Reset" button to clear all fields and reset the live feedback section.

Disable the "Submit" button until all required fields are valid.


Deliverables:
A single HTML file with separate JavaScript and CSS (if needed).

All validation and interactivity must be done using DOM manipulation (no libraries like jQuery).
